# Contributing

We are a coalition of brigades, all volunteers from the Bay Area. We would love
to get help from folks across the state to help us in building a database of
campaign finance data for local jurisdictions across the state.


## Code of conduct

Open California is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free
community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any
community member in any form. This does not only extend to members of Open
California, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger community
of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

This Code of Conduct has been adapted from the [Plone Foundation](http://plone.org/foundation/materials/foundation-resolutions/code-of-conduct) and is licensed

## We work remotely

Being a collaboration of brigades we often meetup in person at our local
brigades without the entire group. It's important to keep the rest of the group
informed. We can't all make it to four brigade meetings a week `;-)` Keep this
in mind as you collaborate and consider posting decisions or learnings to our
[slack](https://opencal.slack.com) or comment on an [issue](/issues).


## Pull requests

Please submit a pull request for any commits, large or small. Pull requests are
a great way to get visibility on changes and keep folks up to date. Please keep
your pull requests of a reasonable size as large pull requests can take longer
to review and merge.


## Branches, not forks

If you're an Open California member, please use branches rather than forks. If
you're new, fork away and submit a pull request when you're ready.

Use prefixes for your branches like `bug/` or `feature/`. You can also use
developer branches `adborden/this-crazy-idea-i-had` to get feedback on an idea
without an intention of merging as-is.
